"""Russian<->English term pairs of the platform (terms.json).

1C:Element is bilingual: `Запрос` is `Query`, the yaml key `ОбластьВидимости` is
`VisibilityScope`, the value `ВПроекте` is `InProject`. Sources may be written either way,
so anything that matches a platform name by text has to accept both spellings.

The pairs are extracted from the distribution (tools/extract_terms.py) and split by ROLE -
`Ссылка` is the property `Link` and the facet part `Reference`, and only the role tells
which is right. Without the data file every helper degrades to the Russian spelling alone:
a missed English spelling is a false negative, inventing one would be a false positive.
