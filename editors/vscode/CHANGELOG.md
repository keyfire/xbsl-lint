# Changelog

## 0.11.4

- README only: the deploy command details and the `xbsl.deploy.*` settings table moved to
  the XBSL Debug README in the [elemctl](https://github.com/keyfire/elemctl) project; this
  README keeps a short pointer.

## 0.11.3

- Fix: a clean file opened after a workspace run showed its diagnostics, but the lightbulb
  offered no Quick Fixes until the first edit. The fix snapshot is now rebuilt from the
  stored raw report of the last workspace run when such a file is opened.
- The Deploy section of the README now defers the tool details to the
  [elemctl](https://github.com/keyfire/elemctl) project; the two projects cross-link each
  other (README and Marketplace pages).

## 0.11.2

- README only: animated demos of the diagnostics with Quick Fix, the form preview and the
  properties panel, plus a pointer to the `demo/` toy project in the repository. No code
  changes.

## 0.11.1

- New rule group **query** in the settings (needs `xbsllint` with the `query/unknown-table`
  rule): tables of the `Запрос{...}` blocks (`ИЗ`/`СОЕДИНЕНИЕ`) are checked against the
  project objects.
- One release consolidating the 0.8.0–0.11.0 changes below.

## 0.11.0

- The form preview gained a **properties panel**, like the platform web editor: a click on an
  element selects it and opens a separate *Properties* tab (drag it wherever suits) – enums as
  dropdowns, `Растягивать*` as Auto / Истина / Ложь toggles, everything else as text; the
  curated standard set of the component plus every property present in the yaml. Edits are
  applied to the yaml document as precise text edits (undo works); an empty value / *(auto)*
  removes the property. Selecting and editing also position the yaml editor on the affected
  line without stealing focus; Ctrl+click or the *Show in yaml* button jumps into the editor
  (plain click selects). Long property names wrap – no horizontal scrolling; wide wireframe
  content scrolls within its own area.

## 0.10.1

- New command *XBSL: form preview* (`xbsl.previewForm`) with a preview button on form yamls:
  a wireframe of the 1C:Element form in a webview – nested groups, labels, fields with
  captions and bindings, buttons, checkboxes, tables with their columns, switchable tabs,
  cards, image/HTML placeholders, and the form command bar. The panel follows the active
  editor and re-renders as you type; clicking an element reveals its yaml node. Unknown and
  custom component types render as labeled boxes with their content.
- The preview toolbar: zoom (−/+, 125% by default) and a theme picker – light (the platform
  web client look, the default), dark, or the editor theme. The choice is remembered.

## 0.9.0

- New settings section **Rule groups**: a dropdown per finding type (code, yaml, style,
  typography, whitespace, encoding, structure, form) – keep the rules' own levels, report
  the whole group at one level, or turn the group off (the rules are then skipped, not just
  hidden). No more hand-typing ids into `xbsl.rules` for the common cases; `xbsl.rules`
  stays as the fine-grained override and beats the dropdowns.
- The "Configure rule..." lightbulb gained a "Configure rule groups..." shortcut into the
  new section.

## 0.8.0

- New command *XBSL: deploy the project (elemctl)* (`xbsl.deploy`), also a cloud button in the
  editor title of `.xbsl` files: runs `elemctl deploy` – build from sources, upload, apply,
  restart, and verification that the apply actually took effect – as a terminal task, after a
  confirmation dialog showing the exact command line. The target comes from the workspace
  folder's `.env` or the new settings `xbsl.deploy.elemctlPath` / `xbsl.deploy.envFile` /
  `xbsl.deploy.appId` / `xbsl.deploy.extraArgs`; a set `xbsl.projectRoot` is passed as
  `--project-dir`. Offers to install elemctl when it is missing.
- The English README now shows the English command titles (bilingual since 0.6.1).

## 0.7.1

- "Install xbsllint" / "Install xbsllint[lsp]" buttons on the corresponding errors: the install
  runs as a terminal task and the check restarts on success.

## 0.7.0

- New setting `xbsl.rules` – per-rule levels and disabling (`off | error | warning | info | hint`
  by rule id or whole group), plus a "Configure rule..." action in every finding's lightbulb.
  Works in both the CLI and the LSP mode.

## 0.6.1

- Bilingual UI (en/ru): the manifest and all runtime strings follow the VS Code display language.

## 0.6.0

- Experimental LSP mode (`xbsl.lsp.enabled`): a long-living `xbsllint-lsp` server brings hover,
  instant as-you-type diagnostics and index navigation; on a failed server start the extension
  falls back to the regular CLI mode by itself.

## 0.5.0

- New command *XBSL: code palette* – recolor XBSL syntax with one of the popular palettes
  (the 1C:Element web IDE style, One Dark, Monokai, Dracula, GitHub Dark) or reset to the
  editor theme; only `*.xbsl` scopes are touched.

## 0.4.1

- New setting `xbsl.projectRoot` – the sources root for project-wide runs and the navigation
  index, for repositories that hold examples or copies next to the project.

## 0.4.0

- Quick Fix for mechanical findings: a lightbulb on a fixable diagnostic (trailing whitespace,
  typography characters – em dash → en dash, `…` → `...`, curly quotes) applies the exact edit the
  linter reports. Needs a linter that emits fixes in its JSON (`xbsllint` ≥ 0.7.1).
- A *fix all* source action (`source.fixAll.xbsl`) fixes every fixable finding in the file at once;
  wire it into `editor.codeActionsOnSave` for fix-on-save. Fixes are applied only against the exact
  text they were computed on (a version-stamped snapshot), so a stale edit is never misplaced.

## 0.3.0

- Go to definition and completion powered by the project index (`xbsllint index`, with the
  `--index` spelling probed as a fallback): objects, tabular sections, local types, enum values,
  methods, form components, yaml `Обработчик:` / `Тип:`. Silent when the installed linter has no
  index command.
- New setting `xbsl.navigation.enabled` (default `true`).

## 0.2.0

- Workspace diagnostics: saving any `.xbsl`/`.yaml` file triggers a full linter run over the
  workspace folder (debounced, one at a time, stale runs cancelled), bringing project-scope
  rules (`code/unknown-type`, `yaml/unknown-type`, ...) into the editor. The workspace result
  replaces the diagnostics of every file; the fast `--stdin` lint owns only the dirty buffer
  being edited.
- New settings: `xbsl.workspaceLint` (on by default) and `xbsl.workspaceLintTimeout`
  (60000 ms; on expiry the run is stopped and logged to the XBSL output channel).
- The *XBSL: проверить весь проект* command reuses the same machinery and result store.
- Activation on `workspaceContains:**/*.xbsl`, so `.yaml`-only editing sessions get
  workspace diagnostics too.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release.
- Syntax highlighting for `.xbsl` (bilingual keywords, decorators, string interpolation, generics).
- On-the-fly diagnostics via `xbsllint --stdin --format json` (on type, debounced, and on save).
- Command *XBSL: проверить весь проект* for a workspace-wide check (including cross-file rules).
- Settings: linter command / Python interpreter, data dir, language, rule select/ignore, run mode,
  debounce.
