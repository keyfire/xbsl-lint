# XBSL for VS Code

**English** · [Русский](https://github.com/keyfire/xbsl/blob/main/editors/vscode/README.ru.md)

Syntax highlighting and on-the-fly linting for **1C:Element** sources (`.xbsl`), powered by the
[xbsl](https://github.com/keyfire/xbsl) linter.

> folder of the repository – a tiny 1C:Element app with a form and a handful of deliberate findings.

## Features

- **Syntax highlighting** for `.xbsl`: keywords (both Russian and English forms), declarations,
  operators, `@`-decorators, numbers, comments, and strings with `%name` / `${...}` interpolation.
- **Live diagnostics** as you type (debounced) and on save – brackets/blocks balance, unused
  locals, typography, code-style conventions, and everything else the linter reports. Squiggles
  carry the rule id (e.g. `code/brackets`) and severity.
- **Workspace diagnostics** – saving any `.xbsl`/`.yaml` file runs the linter over the whole
  workspace folder in the background, so project-scope rules (`code/unknown-type`,
  `yaml/unknown-type`, `Id` uniqueness) show up right in the editor, across all files.
  Controlled by `xbsl.workspaceLint` (on by default).
- **Whole-project check** – the command *XBSL: check the whole project* runs the same
  workspace-wide check on demand.
- **Go to definition, find all references and completion across the project** – powered by a project
  index built by the linter (`xbsl --index`). See [Navigation and completion](#navigation-and-completion).
- **Quick Fix for mechanical findings** – a lightbulb on a fixable diagnostic (trailing
  whitespace, typography characters) applies the exact edit the linter reports; a *fix all*
  source action (`source.fixAll.xbsl`) fixes the whole file and can run on save via
  `editor.codeActionsOnSave`. Needs `xbsl` ≥ 0.7.1. See [Quick Fix](#quick-fix).
- **Deploy to the stand** – the *XBSL: deploy the project (elemctl)* command (and a cloud
  button in the editor title of `.xbsl` files) runs `elemctl deploy` in a terminal task:
  build from sources → upload → apply → restart → verification that the apply actually took
  effect. See [Deploy](#deploy).
- **Form designer** – a panel of three areas: the structure tree on the left, the form's data on
  the right, the form frame under them. It follows the active editor and updates as you type; the
  selection is linked across the areas, the yaml cursor and the **properties panel**. The component
  palette sits next to the metadata tree while the panel is open. See
  [Form designer](#form-designer).
- **Metadata explorer** – a dedicated Activity Bar view: a tree of the project objects grouped by
  `ElementKind`, with subtrees (`Attributes`, `Dimensions`, `Forms`, enum `Values` ...), an editable
  properties panel, creation of objects/fields/subsystems and filtering by subsystem. See
  [Metadata explorer](#metadata-explorer).
- **Documentation** – a dedicated Activity Bar view: the 1C:Element reference the way the docs site
  shows it – a "Contents" tree (the developer and administrator guides, the type and query-language
  references), full-text search, and a page view with images and a link to the primary source.
  Right-click a type or variable to open its documentation. See [Documentation](#documentation).

`.yaml` element descriptions keep their built-in YAML highlighting.

## Requirements

The extension is a thin client over the `xbsl` CLI – it does not bundle a checker. You need:

1. **Python 3.10+** and the linter: `pip install xbsl`. If the linter is missing,
   the extension offers to install it right from the error message.
2. **Element language data** – generated once from your 1C:Element distribution, see
   [step 1 of the linter README](https://github.com/keyfire/xbsl#step-1-generate-the-language-data).
   Without it most rules cannot run; the extension surfaces the linter's error once.

By default the extension calls `xbsl` from `PATH`. Point it elsewhere with
`xbsl.linter.command` (an executable) or `xbsl.linter.pythonPath` (an interpreter – the linter is
then invoked as `<python> -m xbsl`).

## Navigation and completion

The extension asks the linter for a project index once on activation and rebuilds it (debounced,
one process at a time) whenever a `.xbsl`/`.yaml` file is saved. The index command is probed as
`xbsl index <root>` first, then `xbsl --index <root>` as a fallback. If the installed
linter does not support the index yet, navigation silently stays off – details go to the *XBSL*
output channel, no popups.

**Go to definition** (F12 / Ctrl+Click), in `.xbsl` and `.yaml`:

- a project object name (bare, or the root of a dotted chain) → its `.yaml`;
- `<Object>.<LocalType>` → the type declaration; `<Object>.<TabularPart>` → the section in the
  object's yaml; `<Enum>.<Value>` → the value line;
- `<Module>.<Method>` (including manager modules named after the object), and a bare method name
  inside its own module → the method;
- `Components.<Name>` → the component node in the current form's yaml; `Components.<Name>.<Method>`
  → the method of that module;
- in yaml, the value of `Handler: <Name>` → the handler in the paired `.xbsl`.

**Find all references** (Shift+F12, or *Go to References* / *Find All References* in the context menu),
for methods, objects and interface components – every usage, from the same index:

- a method → its calls inside the module, `<Module>.<Method>` and `Components.<Module>.<Method>`
  calls, and the `Handler: <Name>` keys that name it in yaml;
- an object → every place it is the root of a dotted chain;
- a component → its `Components.<Name>` uses in the form's module.

Deeper chains that would need type inference are out of scope, as they are for go-to-definition.

> **A note on names.** 1C:Element is bilingual all the way down: keywords, literals, stdlib types and
> the metadata vocabulary each carry a Russian and an English spelling, and this README uses the
> English one (`var`, `new`, `Query{}`, `Array<String>`, `True`). Sources may be written either way,
> and the extension reads both. The metadata names used below:
>
> | Name | What it is |
> | --- | --- |
> | `Attributes` · `Dimensions` · `Resources` · `TabularParts` | the field sections of an object |
> | `Id` · `Name` · `Type` · `Handler` | the yaml keys an element carries |
> | `Reference` · `Object` | the reference and the object of a type family |
> | `Components` | the components collection of a form |
> | `Multiline` · `Layout` · `HorizontalStretch` · `VerticalStretch` · `Pages` | the properties of a component |

**Completion** (triggered by `.` and `:`):

- after `<Object>.` – the type family (`Reference`, `Object`, ...), `TabularParts`, local types and
  manager-module methods; for an enum – its values;
- after `Components.` – the components of the current form; after `Components.<Name>.` – the methods
  of that module;
- in yaml, after `Type:` – project object names (the object kind is shown as the detail).

**Type-aware completion** – in [LSP mode](#lsp-mode-default) only. The parsing runs over tokens, so
keywords are understood in both of the spellings the language has, the English one and the Russian:

- inside `Query{ ... }`, after a table – its fields: the standard fields of the kind, its
  `Attributes` and `TabularParts`. Aliases resolve too: `FROM Product AS P` → `P.` gives the
  same fields;
- after the loop variable of a query result (`for Row in Result` → `Row.`) – the columns of the
  selection (the `SELECT ... AS` aliases; a plain field is named by its last segment);
- after a variable of a known type (`var List = new Array<String>()` → `List.`) – the members of
  that type. The type comes from the annotation or from `new`; method parameters count as well;
- after an stdlib type or global (`AccessContext.`) – its members. Properties and methods are
  listed apart: a method carries its own icon and is inserted with parentheses.

The members of stdlib types come from the Element data (the `--data-dir` root), everything else
from the project index. A name in scope beats a type of the same name: once a variable `List` is
declared, `List.` is about its type, not about the `List` component. Requires `xbsl` >= 0.10.0.

Known limits – by design: outside LSP mode the index knows declarations, not types (no completion
after variables). Type inference for arbitrary expressions and for dotted chains deeper than one
level is nowhere, and there is no rename. When the context is ambiguous the providers return
nothing rather than guessing.

## Quick Fix

Findings the linter can repair mechanically carry a fix; the extension turns it into a Quick Fix:

- A **lightbulb on the diagnostic** (`Ctrl+.`) – *Fix: `<rule>`* – applies the exact edit:
  trailing whitespace removed, em dash → en dash, `…` → `...`, curly quotes → straight.
- A **fix-all source action** – *Fix all (xbsl)* – repairs every fixable finding in the
  file in one edit. Run it on save by adding to your settings:

  ```json
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": { "source.fixAll.xbsl": "explicit" }
  ```

Fixes need a linter that emits them in its JSON (`xbsl` ≥ 0.7.1). Only unambiguous edits are
offered, and only against the exact text they were computed on – a version-stamped snapshot guards
against applying an offset to text that changed since the last lint. Whole-file fixes (mixed
newlines) are left to `xbsl --fix` on the command line.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `xbsl.linter.run` | `onType` | When to lint: `onType` (debounced) / `onSave` / `off`. |
| `xbsl.linter.command` | `xbsl` | Linter executable (PATH or absolute path). |
| `xbsl.linter.pythonPath` | – | Python interpreter; when set, runs `<python> -m xbsl`. |
| `xbsl.linter.dataDir` | – | Element data root (folder with `index.json`); empty = auto-resolved. |
| `xbsl.linter.lang` | auto | Diagnostic language: ` ` (auto) / `ru` / `en`. |
| `xbsl.linter.select` | – | Only these rules (ids, groups, or tier letters `A`–`D`). |
| `xbsl.linter.ignore` | – | Exclude these rules. |
| `xbsl.rules` | `{}` | Per-rule levels and disabling: `{"style": "off", "code/brackets": "error"}`. See [Rules](#rules-levels-and-disabling). |
| `xbsl.linter.debounce` | `300` | Delay (ms) before linting while typing. |
| `xbsl.projectRoot` | – | Sources root for project-wide runs and the navigation index, relative to the workspace folder (or absolute). Empty – the whole folder. Set it when the repository holds examples or copies next to the project: otherwise project-scope rules (`Id` uniqueness etc.) cross-fire between directories. |
| `xbsl.baseline` | – | Baseline file with the excluded findings, relative to the workspace folder (or absolute). Empty – `.xbsllint-baseline` in the workspace folder when it exists. See [Excluding a finding](#excluding-a-finding-the-baseline). |
| `xbsl.workspaceLint` | `true` | Full workspace run on every save of a `.xbsl`/`.yaml` file. |
| `xbsl.workspaceLintTimeout` | `60000` | Kill a workspace run after this many ms (`0` – no limit). |
| `xbsl.navigation.enabled` | `true` | Index-based go-to-definition and completion. |
| `xbsl.groups.*` | `default` | A dropdown per rule group (code, yaml, project, naming, style, typography, whitespace, encoding, structure, form, query): the rules' own levels, one level for the whole group, or `off`. The **naming** group covers the names of project elements per the platform standard (needs `xbsl` >= 0.11.0). See [Rules](#rules-levels-and-disabling). |
| `xbsl.deploy.*` | – | The deploy command settings – documented in the [XBSL Debug README](https://github.com/keyfire/elemctl/tree/main/editors/vscode#deploy-from-vs-code) of the elemctl project. |

## Rules: levels and disabling

**By group – in the Settings UI.** The **Rule groups** section (search for `xbsl.groups` in
the Settings editor, or browse Extensions → XBSL) has a dropdown per finding type – code,
yaml descriptions, style, typography, whitespace, encoding, structure, forms: keep the
group's own rule levels, report all its findings at one level (error / warning / info /
hint), or turn the group off entirely – `off` does not just hide the findings, it excludes
the rules from the run.

**Per rule – from the finding.** Every finding carries a **"Configure rule..."** action in
its lightbulb (`Ctrl+.`): disable the rule or override its level without leaving the line;
the check reruns right away. The choices land in the `xbsl.rules` setting – a map from a
rule id (`whitespace/trailing`) or a whole group (`style`) to a level or `off`. An exact id
beats its group, and any `xbsl.rules` key beats the group dropdowns. Works in both the CLI
and the LSP mode.

## Excluding a finding (the baseline)

Disabling a rule silences it everywhere; sometimes a single finding must stay unfixed – the
code is right on purpose. For that, every finding carries an **"Exclude this finding (to the
baseline): `<rule>`"** action in its lightbulb (`Ctrl+.`): type the reason, and the finding's
identity (file + rule + message) is recorded in the baseline file together with it. Only that
one finding is excluded – the rule keeps checking every other file and name (to silence a
whole rule, use "Configure rule..." instead). The finding disappears from the editor, and a
CI gate over the same file (`xbsl ... --baseline`) stops reporting it too.

The file is `.xbsllint-baseline` in the workspace folder (created on the first exclusion),
or wherever `xbsl.baseline` points. The reason stays next to the frozen finding, and
`xbsl --write-baseline` keeps it on a rewrite:

```json
"app/Useful.yaml": {
 "naming/number": {
  "The name 'Useful' is singular – ...": { "count": 1, "reason": "a historical name" }
 }
}
```

In the LSP mode the suppression runs on the server and needs the engine 0.15.0 or newer;
the CLI mode works with any engine that has `--baseline`. The identity includes the message
text, so the baseline is bound to the output language – write and check it under the same
`xbsl.linter.lang`.

## LSP mode (default)

The extension runs everything through a long-living `xbsl-lsp` server instead of spawning
the CLI per event: the Element language data and the project index stay resident, so
as-you-type diagnostics respond in milliseconds, **hover** appears (a card for a project
object, method or form component), and so does
[type-aware completion](#navigation-and-completion). Definition, project-wide diagnostics on
save and quick fixes work as before, just faster. Requires the linter installed with the
`[lsp]` extra (`pip install "xbsl[lsp]"`); the server is found as `xbsl-lsp` on
`PATH`, via `xbsl.linter.pythonPath` (run as a module), or by the explicit
`xbsl.lsp.command`.

Without the server the extension quietly keeps working in the former CLI mode (details go to
the *XBSL* output channel, and the status bar shows the mode actually in use). To switch the
server off entirely, set `"xbsl.lsp.enabled": false`; changing the setting needs a window
reload.

## Code palette

The command **XBSL: code palette** (`xbsl.choosePalette`) recolors XBSL syntax with one of
the popular palettes: the 1C:Element web IDE style (red keywords, blue strings), One Dark,
Monokai, Dracula, GitHub Dark – or resets back to the active editor theme. The choice is
applied via `editor.tokenColorCustomizations` rules addressing only `*.xbsl` scopes, so the
global theme and other languages stay untouched; the extension manages only its own rules
(prefixed `xbsl-palette`) and preserves any customizations of yours.

## Form designer

![Form designer: wireframe, themes and live updates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keyfire/xbsl/main/editors/vscode/images/form-preview.gif)

The command **XBSL: form designer** (`xbsl.previewForm`, also a button in the editor title of form
yamls – files whose `ElementKind` is `InterfaceComponent`) opens the form panel. A form depends on
its own properties, so its structure and its data are edited where the form is shown: the structure
tree on the left, the data on the right, the form frame under them, with draggable splitters
between (their position is remembered).

**A panel per form.** A second form opens its own tab next to the first; each panel keeps its own
tree, selection and expansion memory. A panel and its yaml travel as a pair: picking a tab on one
side brings the other forward, and closing the panel closes the form's yaml (an unsaved one is
left alone). The keyboard works inside the panel: the arrows walk the tree, plus `Alt+Up`/
`Alt+Down`, `F2`, `Delete`, `Ctrl+C`/`Ctrl+V` and `Ctrl+Z`/`Ctrl+Y`.

**Structure** – the tree of slots and components with an icon per kind and linter badges. The
context menu and the keys: `Alt+Up`/`Alt+Down` move a component, `F2` renames, `Delete` removes,
`Ctrl+C`/`Ctrl+V` carry a yaml fragment, plus wrapping into a container, duplicating, focusing on a
subtree and the named-only filter. A node drags onto another node: a container takes it inside, a
leaf places it after itself.

**Data** – the component's own `Properties:` and the attributes of the owner object. A double click
or a drag of a record onto a structure node creates an input component with its binding already in
place (`Boolean` -> a checkbox, otherwise an input with `Value: =...`).

**The form frame** renders from the yaml: nested vertical/horizontal groups, labels, input fields
with captions and `=bindings`, buttons (the primary one filled), checkboxes, tables with their real
columns, switchable tabs (`Pages`), cards, image and HTML-container placeholders, and the form's
command bar. Unknown and custom component types render as labeled boxes with their content inside,
so nothing disappears. The area header has a zoom (−/+, the wheel over the control and
`Ctrl+wheel` over the frame) and a theme picker: light (the platform web client look, the
default), dark, or the editor theme – the choice is remembered.

**The selection is shared by the three areas.** A click on a frame block and a cursor move in the
yaml expand whatever collapsed groups stand in the way, land on the node in the structure and fill
the "Properties" panel; the selected node keeps the full selection color wherever the focus is.

**The component palette** sits next to the metadata tree and appears while the form panel is open.
A double click on a palette component inserts it into the selected structure node. Dragging from
the palette into the panel is impossible - the platform does not carry a drag from its own tree
into a webview, which is why insertion is click-driven.

![Properties panel: select an element, edit via dropdowns, the yaml follows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keyfire/xbsl/main/editors/vscode/images/props-panel.gif)

**Properties panel.** A click on an element selects it and opens a separate **Properties**
panel (its own tab – drag it below or aside, wherever suits), like the platform web editor:
enums as dropdowns (`Layout`, alignments, spacings, widths, button kinds), `HorizontalStretch` and
`VerticalStretch` as Auto / `True` / `False` toggles, everything else as text – the component's
standard set plus
every property present in the yaml (object values are shown read-only). Edits land in the
yaml document as precise text edits, so the regular undo works; an empty value / *(auto)*
removes the property. Selecting an element and every edit also position the yaml editor on
the affected line (without stealing focus); Ctrl+click or the *Show in yaml* button jumps
into the editor – handy for navigating large forms.

**Typed value editors.** A color property opens a native color picker plus swatches of the
colors already used in the form and your recent picks – one click reuses a shade. Any
single-line value carries a literal/binding toggle: press `=` to bind the property to data,
and in binding mode an autocomplete offers the bindings already used in the form and the
attributes of the form's owner object (`=Object.Name`); the `abc` button switches
back to a literal.

It is a layout skeleton, not the platform's rendering: composition, nesting and captions are
faithful, exact sizes and styles are not (explicit label colors and font sizes are applied).

**Block presets.** In the structure area, *Save as block preset* on a component stores its
whole subtree under a name (kept across forms and sessions); *Insert block preset* (in the palette
title bar or a node's menu) drops a saved preset into the current selection – a named, persistent version of copy/paste
for the layouts you rebuild often. *Manage block presets* prunes the list.

**Mass edit.** Select several components in the structure area and *Edit selected together* sets (or
clears) one property on all of them at once – pick a key from the ones they already use or type a new
one, then a value; empty clears it. Handy for aligning widths, toggling visibility, or rebinding a
group of fields in one step.

## Metadata explorer

![Metadata explorer: the tree, the properties panel, grouping by subsystem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keyfire/xbsl/main/editors/vscode/images/metadata-tree.gif)

A dedicated **1C:Element** icon in the Activity Bar opens a tree of the project metadata – like the
platform designer, but inside VS Code.

> **Experimental.** The metadata explorer is an experimental feature – expect bugs and rough edges.

**The tree.** The root is the project descriptor, with `Vendor\Name` in grey; its context menu opens
the application module. Below are a **Subsystems** branch and categories by `ElementKind`:
Catalogs, Documents, Information/Accumulation registers, Enumerations, Common modules, HTTP services,
Structures, Client events and so on – each with its own icon. The `.yaml` + `.xbsl` pair of an object
is one row; an object/list form is nested under its owner, forms with no owner go to a **Common
forms** section.

**Object subtrees.** A catalog/document expands into **Attributes**, **Tabular sections**, **Forms**;
a register into **Dimensions**, **Resources**, **Attributes**; an enumeration into **Values**; a
structure into **Fields**; client-work parameters into **Parameters**; an HTTP service into **URL
templates** with their methods.

**Clicks.** An object or a field opens the **properties panel** on the right (a field's `Type` is a
combo of primitives, reference types (`<Object>.Reference?`) and the project enumerations, and still
accepts a typed-in value); a common module opens its `.xbsl`; a form opens the preview. The context
menu adds *Properties*, open description / module.

**Properties panel** (the same one the form designer uses). Scalar properties are edited in place:
dropdowns for `VisibilityScope` and `Environment`, a `True` / `False` toggle, text for the rest.
`Id` and `ElementKind` are read-only; collections (`Attributes` and the like) are edited in the tree.
Edits are surgical (undo works); save the file (Ctrl+S) to refresh the tree.

Composite (nested) properties – `ContentHorizontalAlign { ... }`, say – are shown but not
editable: edit those in the yaml.

**Creating objects.** A category root has an **Add &lt;class&gt;** action (Add catalog, Add document,
Add enumeration, Add information/accumulation register, Add common module, Add HTTP service, Add
structure, Add client event, Add command-interface fragment, Add client-work parameters, Add common
form): it asks a name and a subsystem (folder), writes a minimal valid yaml (a fresh `Id`; a paired
`.xbsl` for module kinds) and opens it. Classes are shown even when the project has none of them yet.
In the subtree groups a **"+"** adds an attribute / dimension / resource / value / parameter / field /
tabular section; a catalog/document has **Add object form**: the engine generates a form populated
from the object's `Attributes` (optionally a list form with columns too) and registers it in the
owner's `Interface`.

The templates and yaml edits are computed by the engine (`xbsl` 0.16+): the same operations are
available to agents through its `meta_*` MCP tools and to any editor through the `xbsl/meta*` LSP
requests or the CLI subcommands – the tree only gathers parameters and applies the returned
changes (regular undo works).

![Creating an object from the tree: a new catalog and its attribute](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keyfire/xbsl/main/editors/vscode/images/metadata-create.gif)

**Subsystems.** A **Subsystems** branch lists the subsystem folders (a click opens the subsystem
file); **Add subsystem** creates a folder with a subsystem file. The project root has **Filter by
subsystem** (multi-select) and **Clear filter**; the active filter is shown in grey.

**Git status.** Object, form, subsystem and project rows carry the file's SCM decoration (color and
badge) like the Explorer, while keeping their kind icon.

**Deletion.** Right-click an object – **Delete object** (with confirmation; removes the object files,
undoable; references are left as is – the linter flags dangling ones).

A created object is a scaffold in files – it does not deploy on its own; a broken one only surfaces
on the next deploy (elemctl catches the rollback) and never corrupts your working files.

### Example: a demo app from the tree, deployed to 1cmycloud.com

The tree can assemble a working app from scratch (the yaml is produced by the same templates the tree
uses):

1. Open a folder with a project file – the project root appears in the tree.
2. **Subsystems → "+" → Add subsystem** → `Main`.
3. **Catalogs → "+" → Add catalog** → `Products` (subsystem `Main`); the same for `Categories`.
4. Under `Products` → **Attributes → "+" → Add attribute** → `Price`, `SKU`.
5. **Enumerations → Add enumeration** → `ProductStatus`; in **Values** → `InStock`, `OnOrder`.
6. Deploy: `elemctl deploy --app-id <app> --project-dir <project folder> --output <tmp>`
   (create the app first: `elemctl apps ensure <app> --latest-build --wait`).

The deploy report on 1cmycloud.com (`ok: true` only on an actual apply):

```
built archive <project> 1.0-N.xasm (version 1.0-N)
build uploaded, apply started, waiting for the app to stabilize...
app is Running, verifying the actual applied version...
verification passed: the build is applied
{
  "uri": "https://<app-host>.1cmycloud.com/applications/<app>",
  "status": "Running",
  "applied-version": "1.0-N",
  "applied": true,
  "uri-status": 200,
  "problems": [],
  "ok": true
}
```

`applied: true` and `ok: true` mean the build actually took effect – the `Products` / `Categories`
catalogs and the `ProductStatus` enumeration built by the tree are then available in the standard UI
(the demo needs no OIDC/login).

## Documentation

The **1C:Element** container in the Activity Bar hosts, below the metadata explorer, a
**Documentation** view – the platform reference the way the docs site shows it.

**The tree.** A curated "Contents" that mirrors the site: the developer and administrator guides,
the type reference (`Std::Collections` → `Array` → ...) and the query language. It is built from the
distribution's own sidebar, so the structure matches the site. Clicking a node opens the page.

**Search.** The search button in the view title (command *XBSL: search the documentation*) runs a
full-text search over the whole reference and guide; pick a hit to open it.

**The page.** Opens in a side panel: the cleaned article with code, tables and images, plus a
**Primary source** link to the same page on the docs site. Internal links navigate within the panel,
and opening a page reveals it in the Contents tree.

**Documentation for the symbol.** Right-click a type or variable in an `.xbsl` file – *XBSL:
documentation for the symbol* – to open its page. For a type its reference page opens directly; for a
method or an ambiguous name a pick-list of candidates is shown, ranked by the receiver before the dot
(so `Job.Setup` prefers the scheduled-job pages, not a guide topic).

The data comes from the linter's LSP server, so it needs [LSP mode](#lsp-mode-default) and the
documentation database built from your distribution (`xbsl` ≥ 0.12.0, see
[the linter README](https://github.com/keyfire/xbsl#documentation-searching-the-element-reference)).
In the regular (CLI) mode the view reports that the documentation is available in LSP mode.

## Deploy

The command **XBSL: deploy the project (elemctl)** (`xbsl.deploy`, also a cloud button in the
editor title of `.xbsl` files) runs `elemctl deploy` – build, upload, apply and verification
that the apply actually took effect – as a terminal task, after a confirmation dialog with
the exact command line. The `xbsl.deploy.*` settings, the deploy cycle and the `ELEMENT_*`
configuration are documented in the
[XBSL Debug README](https://github.com/keyfire/elemctl/tree/main/editors/vscode#deploy-from-vs-code)
of the [elemctl](https://github.com/keyfire/elemctl) project
([Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=keyfire.xbsl-debug)).

## Commands

- **XBSL: check the whole project** (`xbsl.lintProject`) – lint the whole workspace.
- **XBSL: restart the linter** (`xbsl.restartLinter`) – clear and re-lint open files.
- **XBSL: code palette** (`xbsl.choosePalette`) – pick a syntax palette for XBSL (see above).
- **Metadata explorer** commands (`xbsl.metadata.*`) are invoked from the tree and its context
  menus: properties, add object / field / subsystem, add object form, filter by subsystem, delete
  object, refresh. See [Metadata explorer](#metadata-explorer).
- **XBSL: deploy the project (elemctl)** (`xbsl.deploy`) – deploy to the stand (see above).
- **XBSL: form designer** (`xbsl.previewForm`) – the panel of the active form yaml (see above).
- **XBSL: search the documentation** (`xbsl.docs.search`) and **documentation for the symbol**
  (`xbsl.docs.showForSymbol`) – the Documentation view (see above).

## How it works

The extension is a thin client of the [xbsl](https://github.com/keyfire/xbsl) engine: in the
default [LSP mode](#lsp-mode-default) every feature – diagnostics, navigation, the docs panel
and the metadata scaffolding – talks to one long-living `xbsl-lsp` server; without the server
the same checks and scaffolding run through the CLI:

![The extension features (diagnostics, metadata tree, form preview, docs panel) talk to the long-living xbsl-lsp server or, as a fallback, to the CLI; the engine reads the project sources and honors the baseline; scaffolding edits come back as full texts and are applied as one undoable WorkspaceEdit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keyfire/xbsl/main/editors/vscode/images/how-it-works.png)

In the CLI mode two producers feed one diagnostic collection, and the split is by buffer state:

- **While you type** (dirty buffer) the extension runs
  `xbsl --stdin --filename <name> --format json` on the live text – per-file rules only,
  fast, debounced. Its result replaces the diagnostics of *that buffer only*.
- **When you save** any `.xbsl`/`.yaml` file, the extension runs
  `xbsl <workspace folder> --format json` in the background (debounced, at most one run
  at a time; a save during a run cancels the now-stale run and starts over). The result covers
  per-file *and* project-scope rules, so it replaces the diagnostics of *every* file in the
  folder – except buffers that are dirty again by then: those stay with their live `--stdin`
  diagnostics until the next save.

This way there are no duplicates and no rule is lost: a clean file always shows the full
workspace-run picture, a file being edited shows the instant per-file picture, and each save
reconciles the two. Both runs speak the same `{diagnostics, summary}` JSON contract that the
linter's MCP server exposes.

A workspace run that fails or exceeds `xbsl.workspaceLintTimeout` is reported to the *XBSL*
output channel only – no popups on every save.

## Feedback and bugs

The extension is under active development, and bugs and rough edges are expected – the metadata
explorer and the form designer especially. Please report anything that looks wrong, ideally with
the steps to reproduce and the extension/engine versions from the status bar, in the project's
GitHub issues:

**https://github.com/keyfire/xbsl/issues**

VS Code also offers *Report Issue* on the extension's page (from the manifest's `bugs` link).

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run compile          # esbuild bundle -> dist/extension.js
npm run check            # tsc type-check
npm test                 # unit tests for the navigation core (plain Node, no runner)
npm run package          # build the .vsix (via @vscode/vsce)
```

Press **F5** in VS Code to launch an Extension Development Host with the extension loaded.
