# XBSL for VS Code

**English** · [Русский](https://github.com/keyfire/xbsl-lint/blob/main/editors/vscode/README.ru.md)

Syntax highlighting and on-the-fly linting for **1C:Element** sources (`.xbsl`), powered by the
[xbsllint](https://github.com/keyfire/xbsl-lint) linter.

![XBSL: syntax highlighting and an inline lint diagnostic from xbsllint](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keyfire/xbsl-lint/main/editors/vscode/images/demo.png)

## Features

- **Syntax highlighting** for `.xbsl`: keywords (both Russian and English forms), declarations,
  operators, `@`-decorators, numbers, comments, and strings with `%name` / `${...}` interpolation.
- **Live diagnostics** as you type (debounced) and on save – brackets/blocks balance, unused
  locals, typography, code-style conventions, and everything else the linter reports. Squiggles
  carry the rule id (e.g. `code/brackets`) and severity.
- **Workspace diagnostics** – saving any `.xbsl`/`.yaml` file runs the linter over the whole
  workspace folder in the background, so project-scope rules (`code/unknown-type`,
  `yaml/unknown-type`, `Ид` uniqueness) show up right in the editor, across all files.
  Controlled by `xbsl.workspaceLint` (on by default).
- **Whole-project check** – the command *XBSL: check the whole project* runs the same
  workspace-wide check on demand.
- **Go to definition and completion across the project** – powered by a project index built by
  the linter (`xbsllint --index`). See [Navigation and completion](#navigation-and-completion).
- **Quick Fix for mechanical findings** – a lightbulb on a fixable diagnostic (trailing
  whitespace, typography characters) applies the exact edit the linter reports; a *fix all*
  source action (`source.fixAll.xbsl`) fixes the whole file and can run on save via
  `editor.codeActionsOnSave`. Needs `xbsllint` ≥ 0.7.1. See [Quick Fix](#quick-fix).
- **Deploy to the stand** – the *XBSL: deploy the project (elemctl)* command (and a cloud
  button in the editor title of `.xbsl` files) runs `elemctl deploy` in a terminal task:
  build from sources → upload → apply → restart → verification that the apply actually took
  effect. See [Deploy](#deploy).
- **Form preview** – a wireframe of a form yaml in a side panel: groups, fields, buttons,
  tables, tabs, cards; follows the active editor, updates as you type, click-through to the
  yaml node. See [Form preview](#form-preview).

`.yaml` element descriptions keep their built-in YAML highlighting.

## Requirements

The extension is a thin client over the `xbsllint` CLI – it does not bundle a checker. You need:

1. **Python 3.10+** and the linter: `pip install xbsllint`. If the linter is missing,
   the extension offers to install it right from the error message.
2. **Element language data** – generated once from your 1C:Element distribution, see
   [step 1 of the linter README](https://github.com/keyfire/xbsl-lint#step-1-generate-the-language-data).
   Without it most rules cannot run; the extension surfaces the linter's error once.

By default the extension calls `xbsllint` from `PATH`. Point it elsewhere with
`xbsl.linter.command` (an executable) or `xbsl.linter.pythonPath` (an interpreter – the linter is
then invoked as `<python> -m xbsllint`).

## Navigation and completion

The extension asks the linter for a project index once on activation and rebuilds it (debounced,
one process at a time) whenever a `.xbsl`/`.yaml` file is saved. The index command is probed as
`xbsllint index <root>` first, then `xbsllint --index <root>` as a fallback. If the installed
linter does not support the index yet, navigation silently stays off – details go to the *XBSL*
output channel, no popups.

**Go to definition** (F12 / Ctrl+Click), in `.xbsl` and `.yaml`:

- a project object name (bare, or the root of a dotted chain) → its `.yaml`;
- `Объект.ЛокальныйТип` → the type declaration; `Объект.ТабличнаяЧасть` → the section in the
  object's yaml; `Перечисление.Значение` → the value line;
- `Модуль.Метод` (including manager modules named after the object), and a bare method name
  inside its own module → the method;
- `Компоненты.Имя` → the component node in the current form's yaml; `Компоненты.Имя.Метод` → the
  method of that module;
- in yaml, the value of `Обработчик: Имя` → the handler in the paired `.xbsl`.

**Completion** (triggered by `.` and `:`):

- after `Объект.` – the type family (`Ссылка`, `Объект`, ...), tabular sections, local types and
  manager-module methods; for an enum – its values;
- after `Компоненты.` – components of the current form; after `Компоненты.X.` – methods of
  module `X`;
- in yaml after `Тип:` – project object names (the object kind is shown as the detail).

Known limits – by design, the index knows declarations, not types: no completion after variables
or arbitrary expressions, no type inference for dotted chains deeper than one level, no rename.
When the context is ambiguous the providers return nothing rather than guessing.

## Quick Fix

Findings the linter can repair mechanically carry a fix; the extension turns it into a Quick Fix:

- A **lightbulb on the diagnostic** (`Ctrl+.`) – *Fix: `<rule>`* – applies the exact edit:
  trailing whitespace removed, em dash → en dash, `…` → `...`, curly quotes → straight.
- A **fix-all source action** – *Fix all (xbsllint)* – repairs every fixable finding in the
  file in one edit. Run it on save by adding to your settings:

  ```json
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": { "source.fixAll.xbsl": "explicit" }
  ```

Fixes need a linter that emits them in its JSON (`xbsllint` ≥ 0.7.1). Only unambiguous edits are
offered, and only against the exact text they were computed on – a version-stamped snapshot guards
against applying an offset to text that changed since the last lint. Whole-file fixes (mixed
newlines) are left to `xbsllint --fix` on the command line.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `xbsl.linter.run` | `onType` | When to lint: `onType` (debounced) / `onSave` / `off`. |
| `xbsl.linter.command` | `xbsllint` | Linter executable (PATH or absolute path). |
| `xbsl.linter.pythonPath` | – | Python interpreter; when set, runs `<python> -m xbsllint`. |
| `xbsl.linter.dataDir` | – | Element data root (folder with `index.json`); empty = auto-resolved. |
| `xbsl.linter.lang` | auto | Diagnostic language: ` ` (auto) / `ru` / `en`. |
| `xbsl.linter.select` | – | Only these rules (ids, groups, or tier letters `A`–`D`). |
| `xbsl.linter.ignore` | – | Exclude these rules. |
| `xbsl.rules` | `{}` | Per-rule levels and disabling: `{"style": "off", "code/brackets": "error"}`. See [Rules](#rules-levels-and-disabling). |
| `xbsl.linter.debounce` | `300` | Delay (ms) before linting while typing. |
| `xbsl.projectRoot` | – | Sources root for project-wide runs and the navigation index, relative to the workspace folder (or absolute). Empty – the whole folder. Set it when the repository holds examples or copies next to the project: otherwise project-scope rules (`Ид` uniqueness etc.) cross-fire between directories. |
| `xbsl.workspaceLint` | `true` | Full workspace run on every save of a `.xbsl`/`.yaml` file. |
| `xbsl.workspaceLintTimeout` | `60000` | Kill a workspace run after this many ms (`0` – no limit). |
| `xbsl.navigation.enabled` | `true` | Index-based go-to-definition and completion. |
| `xbsl.groups.*` | `default` | A dropdown per rule group (code, yaml, style, typography, whitespace, encoding, structure, form): the rules' own levels, one level for the whole group, or `off`. See [Rules](#rules-levels-and-disabling). |
| `xbsl.deploy.elemctlPath` | `elemctl` | The elemctl executable for the deploy command. |
| `xbsl.deploy.envFile` | – | A `.env` with the connection and the target, passed as `--env-file` (relative to the workspace folder or absolute). Empty – the workspace folder's own `.env`. |
| `xbsl.deploy.appId` | – | Target application (`--app-id`); empty – `ELEMENT_APP_ID` from the environment / `.env`. |
| `xbsl.deploy.extraArgs` | – | Extra `elemctl deploy` arguments, space-separated. |

## Rules: levels and disabling

**By group – in the Settings UI.** The **Rule groups** section (search for `xbsl.groups` in
the Settings editor, or browse Extensions → XBSL) has a dropdown per finding type – code,
yaml descriptions, style, typography, whitespace, encoding, structure, forms: keep the
group's own rule levels, report all its findings at one level (error / warning / info /
hint), or turn the group off entirely – `off` does not just hide the findings, it excludes
the rules from the run.

**Per rule – from the finding.** Every finding carries a **"Configure rule..."** action in
its lightbulb (`Ctrl+.`): disable the rule or override its level without leaving the line;
the check reruns right away. The choices land in the `xbsl.rules` setting – a map from a
rule id (`whitespace/trailing`) or a whole group (`style`) to a level or `off`. An exact id
beats its group, and any `xbsl.rules` key beats the group dropdowns. Works in both the CLI
and the LSP mode.

## LSP mode (experimental)

With `"xbsl.lsp.enabled": true` the extension runs everything through a long-living
`xbsllint-lsp` server instead of spawning the CLI per event: the Element language data and
the project index stay resident, so as-you-type diagnostics respond in milliseconds, and
**hover** appears (a card for a project object, method or form component). Definition,
completion, project-wide diagnostics on save and quick fixes work as before, just faster.
Requires the linter installed with the `[lsp]` extra (`pip install "xbsllint[lsp]"`); the
server is found as `xbsllint-lsp` on `PATH`, via `xbsl.linter.pythonPath` (run as a
module), or by the explicit `xbsl.lsp.command`. If the server fails to start, the
extension falls back to the regular CLI mode by itself. Toggling the setting needs a
window reload.

## Code palette

The command **XBSL: code palette** (`xbsl.choosePalette`) recolors XBSL syntax with one of
the popular palettes: the 1C:Element web IDE style (red keywords, blue strings), One Dark,
Monokai, Dracula, GitHub Dark – or resets back to the active editor theme. The choice is
applied via `editor.tokenColorCustomizations` rules addressing only `*.xbsl` scopes, so the
global theme and other languages stay untouched; the extension manages only its own rules
(prefixed `xbsl-palette`) and preserves any customizations of yours.

## Form preview

The command **XBSL: form preview** (`xbsl.previewForm`, also a preview button in the editor
title of form yamls – files with `КомпонентИнтерфейса`) renders a wireframe of a 1C:Element
form from its yaml: nested vertical/horizontal groups, labels, input fields with captions and
`=bindings`, buttons (the primary one filled), checkboxes, tables with their real columns,
switchable tabs (`Страницы`), cards, image and HTML-container placeholders, and the form's
command bar. Unknown and custom component types render as labeled boxes with their content
inside, so nothing disappears.

The panel follows the active yaml editor and re-renders as you type (debounced). A click on
any element reveals its yaml node in the editor – handy for navigating large forms. The
toolbar has a zoom (−/+, 125% by default) and a theme picker: light (the platform web client
look, the default), dark, or the editor theme – the choice is remembered. It is a layout
skeleton, not the platform's rendering: composition, nesting and captions are faithful,
exact sizes and styles are not (explicit label colors and font sizes are applied).

## Deploy

The command **XBSL: deploy the project (elemctl)** (`xbsl.deploy`, also a cloud button in the
editor title of `.xbsl` files) deploys the project to an application on the 1C:Element platform
via [elemctl](https://github.com/keyfire/elemctl): build from sources → upload → apply →
restart → **verification that the apply actually took effect**. (On a failed apply the platform
silently rolls the application back while still reporting `Running`; elemctl does not trust the
status and exits non-zero.)

The extension shows the exact command line in a confirmation dialog, then runs it as a terminal
task, so the progress and the final JSON report stay visible; a notification reports the outcome.
The task's working directory is the workspace folder: elemctl reads the connection and the
target from its `.env` (`ELEMENT_BASE_URL`, `ELEMENT_CLIENT_ID`/`SECRET`, `ELEMENT_APP_ID`,
`ELEMENT_PROJECT_ID`) – or from the file named in `xbsl.deploy.envFile` (handy in a git worktree
whose `.env` lives in the main checkout). When `xbsl.projectRoot` narrows the sources root, it
is passed as `--project-dir`. Needs elemctl on `PATH` (`pip install elemctl`) or
`xbsl.deploy.elemctlPath`; when it is missing, the extension offers to install it.

## Commands

- **XBSL: check the whole project** (`xbsl.lintProject`) – lint the whole workspace.
- **XBSL: restart the linter** (`xbsl.restartLinter`) – clear and re-lint open files.
- **XBSL: code palette** (`xbsl.choosePalette`) – pick a syntax palette for XBSL (see above).
- **XBSL: deploy the project (elemctl)** (`xbsl.deploy`) – deploy to the stand (see above).
- **XBSL: form preview** (`xbsl.previewForm`) – a wireframe of the active form yaml (see above).

## How it works

Two producers feed one diagnostic collection, and the split is by buffer state:

- **While you type** (dirty buffer) the extension runs
  `xbsllint --stdin --filename <name> --format json` on the live text – per-file rules only,
  fast, debounced. Its result replaces the diagnostics of *that buffer only*.
- **When you save** any `.xbsl`/`.yaml` file, the extension runs
  `xbsllint <workspace folder> --format json` in the background (debounced, at most one run
  at a time; a save during a run cancels the now-stale run and starts over). The result covers
  per-file *and* project-scope rules, so it replaces the diagnostics of *every* file in the
  folder – except buffers that are dirty again by then: those stay with their live `--stdin`
  diagnostics until the next save.

This way there are no duplicates and no rule is lost: a clean file always shows the full
workspace-run picture, a file being edited shows the instant per-file picture, and each save
reconciles the two. Both runs speak the same `{diagnostics, summary}` JSON contract that the
linter's MCP server exposes.

A workspace run that fails or exceeds `xbsl.workspaceLintTimeout` is reported to the *XBSL*
output channel only – no popups on every save.
