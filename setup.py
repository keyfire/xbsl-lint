"""Optional native build of the hot modules.

By default the package builds pure Python - setup.py adds nothing. With the env
`XBSL_MYPYC=1` the lexer and the parser are compiled by mypyc into C extensions (measured
on the corpus - a multiple speedup of tokenization and parsing); an installed mypy and a
C compiler are required (MSVC Build Tools on Windows). The modules remain ordinary Python
code: without the flag, or on a platform without a wheel, everything works as before -
the extension merely replaces them at import time.

    XBSL_MYPYC=1 python -m build            # a wheel with the native lexer/parser
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace     # locally, .pyd/.so next to the sources
