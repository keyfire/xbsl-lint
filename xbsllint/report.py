"""The machine-readable report shape, shared by the CLI (--format json), the MCP server and editors.

One contract for structured output — a list of diagnostics plus a summary — so that the CLI and the
MCP adapter cannot drift apart. Editors (the VS Code extension) consume the same JSON.

CI integration lives here too: codeclimate() renders the diagnostics as a GitLab Code Quality
report (a subset of the Code Climate issue format), which GitLab shows as a widget on merge
requests (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/testing/code_quality.html).
