![CI](https://github.com/keyfire/xbsl/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

The XBSL (1C:Element) toolkit: a linter with autofixes, an LSP server, a project index,
platform documentation search, metadata scaffolding and an MCP server for AI agents.
It works on `Name.yaml` (element description) and `Name.xbsl` (code module) pairs –
before the server-side compilation that happens on deploy.

> Before 0.16 the project was named **xbsl-lint** (the `xbsllint` package). The old names
> keep working: the `xbsllint*` commands are aliases of the new ones, `import xbsllint`
> returns the `xbsl` modules, and both spellings of the environment variables and
> entry-point groups are honored.

> Not affiliated with 1C. "1C:Element", "1C:Fresh" and related names are trademarks of their
> respective owners. Language data is generated from your own distribution. See [NOTICE](https://github.com/keyfire/xbsl/blob/main/NOTICE).

Development notes and updates (in Russian): the [1C × AI: engineering workshop](https://t.me/ceh_1c_ai) Telegram channel.

## Why

1C:Element has no external tooling: the only code check is the server-side compilation on deploy –
it is slow and knows nothing about project conventions. xbsl gives fast local feedback, catches
what the compiler does not check at all, and takes over the metadata mechanics – creating
objects, attributes and forms.

## How it works

One engine, four surfaces. The core reads the `Имя.yaml` + `Имя.xbsl` pairs, and the scaffolding
writes them back; the CLI, the LSP server, the MCP server and the web UI are thin adapters over
the same core, so every surface sees the same rules, data and templates:

![The engine core (linter, autofixes, project index, docs search) and the metadata scaffolding read and write the project sources; a private plugin adds Element language data and custom rules via entry points; the CLI, the LSP server (VS Code), the MCP server (AI agents) and the web UI are surfaces over the same core](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keyfire/xbsl/main/images/how-it-works.png)

## Step 1: generate the language data

The linter relies on language tables (bilingual keywords, operators), an stdlib type catalog, and
the configuration metamodel (element properties). XBSL is built on Eclipse Xtext + ANTLR; these are
extracted from **your** 1C:Element distribution (the `InternalBsl.g` grammar, the documentation, and
the `.xcore` metamodel) and are NOT bundled in this repository. Generate them locally:

```sh
python tools/extract_grammar.py   --dist "<path to the 1C:Element distribution>"
python tools/extract_stdlib.py    --dist "<path to the 1C:Element distribution>"
python tools/extract_metamodel.py --dist "<path to the 1C:Element distribution>"
```

The scripts auto-detect the platform version and place the data under
`xbsl/data/element/<version>/` (this folder is gitignored). Without the data, the linter and
the tests will tell you to generate it. Pass `--data-dir` (or set `XBSL_DATA_DIR`) to write the
data somewhere else – for instance into a private package that ships it, see
[Extending](#extending-your-own-rules-and-data).

## Step 2: install and run

```sh
pip install xbsl            # or, from a clone: pip install -e .
xbsl path/to/sources        # or: python -m xbsl path/to/sources
xbsl self-update            # upgrade to the latest PyPI version
```

`self-update` upgrades the package by unpacking the wheel straight into site-packages – safe
even when `pip install --upgrade` fails with WinError 32 because an exe is busy (the typical
case: `xbsl-lsp.exe` held by the VS Code LSP server, `xbsl-mcp.exe` by an agent's MCP
session). The busy stubs are left alone and pick up the new code on the next start; restart
the long-living processes after the update. `--version X.Y.Z` installs a specific version.
In an editable install from a clone the command refuses – `git pull` updates that one.

The extractors from step 1 ship with the repository, not with the PyPI package – clone the
repository to generate the data.

The hot modules (the lexer and the parser) can be compiled by mypyc into C extensions:
`XBSL_MYPYC=1` at build time (needs mypy and a C compiler: MSVC Build Tools on Windows,
Xcode CLT on macOS, gcc on Linux). Users never need a compiler: the ready-made native
wheels are built by CI (`native-wheels.yml`), and without a matching wheel the package
runs as plain Python – no compiler, no loss of functionality.

Flags: `--list-rules`, `--where` (data root, source and versions), `--select`/`--enable`/`--ignore` (by rule id, rule group – the part of the id
before `/` – or tier letter), `--fix`, `--baseline`/`--write-baseline`, `--element-version`,
`--data-dir`, `--lang`, `--format text|json|codeclimate`.
`--fix` repairs the mechanical findings in place – trailing whitespace, typography characters
(em dash → en dash, `…` → `...`, curly quotes and comment guillemets → straight), and mixed
newlines (normalized to the dominant style) – then reports whatever is left. It only applies
unambiguous edits and only for rules active in the run (so `--fix --enable typography` also pays
down the em-dash/guillemets debt); anything needing judgment is never touched.
For editor integration, `--stdin --filename NAME` checks a single buffer read from stdin (per-file
rules only); the JSON payload (`{diagnostics, summary}`) is the same one the MCP server returns.
`xbsl --index PATH` dumps a JSON index of the project to stdout instead of linting – the
objects (with tabular sections, module-declared local types and the member families for dot
completion), the method declarations with their annotations and the named form components, with
POSIX paths relative to the root and 1-based lines – for go-to-definition and completion in
editors.
`--format codeclimate` emits a GitLab Code Quality report (Code Climate issues) with paths relative
to the current directory – run it from the repository root and save the output as the
`codequality` artifact.

## Output language

Rule titles and diagnostic messages come in Russian and English. The language is picked by
`--lang ru|en` > the `XBSL_LANG` env var > the system locale > Russian. Type names, keywords
and other XBSL text inside a message are never translated – only the wording around them. The MCP
server and the web panel follow the same setting (the web panel also has an in-page RU/EN toggle).

## Use in CI

`xbsl` exits non-zero only when a run produces an **error-severity** finding, so it works as a
pipeline gate as-is – warnings and `info` do not fail the build. The one prerequisite is the
language data (see [Step 1](#step-1-generate-the-language-data)): generate it in the job (the
extractors ship with the repository, so check the repo out), or depend on a package that ships the
data via the `xbsl.data` entry point (see [Extending](#extending-your-own-rules-and-data)) and
just `pip install` it.

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
lint:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with: { python-version: "3.12" }
    - run: pip install xbsl
    # generate the data from your 1C:Element distribution (or install a package that ships it):
    - run: |
        python tools/extract_grammar.py  --dist "$ELEMENT_DIST"
        python tools/extract_stdlib.py   --dist "$ELEMENT_DIST"
        python tools/extract_metamodel.py --dist "$ELEMENT_DIST"
    - run: xbsl acme/          # fails the job on any error-severity finding
```

### GitLab CI (Code Quality widget)

`--format codeclimate` writes a Code Climate report that GitLab renders inline on the merge request.
Run it from the repository root and save the output as the `codequality` report. The command still
returns non-zero on error-severity findings, so `artifacts.when: always` keeps the report even when
the job gates the pipeline (drop the gate with a trailing `|| true` if you want the widget only):

```yaml
lint:
  script:
    - pip install xbsl
    - xbsl --format codeclimate acme/ > gl-code-quality-report.json
  artifacts:
    when: always
    reports:
      codequality: gl-code-quality-report.json
```

## Rule tiers

**The full list of all 86 rules** (severity, default state, scope, links to platform
documentation sections) is in [docs/RULES.md](docs/RULES.md); at runtime – `xbsl list-rules`.
Below is an overview by tier.

- **A. Structure and YAML** – `.xbsl`/`.yaml` pairing, schema validity, `Ид` as a UUID,
  `Ид` uniqueness, `Имя` matching the file name.
- **B. Text and conventions** – typography (en dash, straight quotes),
  encoding/BOM/newlines/trailing whitespace, indentation and line length.
- **C. Code structure** – balance of blocks and `;`, brackets, unused local and loop variables,
  a structure reference field that must be `обз`, plus the platform's code style conventions
  (the `style/` group, see below).
- **D. Semantics** – against platform data and the project itself: types, enumeration values,
  cross-file consistency (see below).

The type rules of tier D cover every type position in code (`новый`, `как` casts, annotations,
signatures) and every `Тип:` value in yaml (unions `А|Б|?`, generics, nullable): the root must
be a known type – stdlib, a project object, a module-declared local type or a global type of a
declared library (see below) – and a dotted chain
rooted at a project object must stay within the family that object generates: the derived types
extracted from the distribution docs (`Ссылка`, `Объект`, `СоздатьОбъект`, the automatic
forms...), its tabular sections and module structures. Namespace-qualified references
(`Справочник.X.Ссылка`) also check that the object exists under that kind, and the values of
project enumerations are verified both in code and in yaml bindings.

The types of the declared libraries come from their archives. `Проект.yaml` declares the
coordinates only (`Поставщик`, `Имя`, `Версия`), so the names are read from the
`{Поставщик}-{Имя}-{Версия}.xlib` archive, looked up in the project descriptor's directory and
above it (up to four levels) - where the archive sits when the sources are shipped. An element
becomes known when it is `ОбластьВидимости: Глобально`; the rest is the library's own business.
With no archive next to the sources the library types stay unknown, exactly as they were before
libraries were understood at all.

The cross-file rules of tier D catch what the compiler reports late or not at all: a yaml
handler missing from the paired module, a foreign-subsystem type used without an `Импорт:`
entry, a dynamic list typed by the automatic list form that misses an attribute of its object,
a cross-component `Компоненты.X.Метод()` call to a method without a visibility annotation,
environment mismatches (`@НаСервере` called from a client handler without `@ДоступноСКлиента`,
a client-only module used from an HTTP service), reserved names (`Тип`/`type` as a field or
parameter, a component property named like a built-in one), methods that nothing references,
and top-level yaml properties against the configuration metamodel. The `query/` group
parses `Запрос{ ... }` blocks and verifies the tables of `ИЗ`/`СОЕДИНЕНИЕ` against the
project objects and their tabular sections; a block with constructs outside the supported
subset (temporary tables, unions, subqueries) is skipped whole rather than guessed.

Detailed group descriptions - `query/` (a composite type in `IN` with a subquery),
`project/` (project properties), `naming/` (the naming standard, the `[morph]` extra) and
`style/` (code-writing conventions and their on/off policy) - live in [docs/RULES.md](docs/RULES.md).

## Baseline: adopt a rule on a legacy codebase

To enable a rule over code that already violates it without drowning in legacy findings, freeze the
current findings into a baseline and hold only new code to the rule:

```sh
xbsl acme/app --enable style --write-baseline baseline.json   # freeze the debt once
xbsl acme/app --enable style --baseline baseline.json         # only NEW findings surface
```

A finding's identity is `(file, rule, message)` with an allowed count, so moving a line keeps its
finding suppressed while a genuinely new violation surfaces. The summary reports how many findings
the baseline suppressed and how many of its entries are now stale (debt paid down) – a signal to
rewrite the file. Paths are stored relative to the baseline file, so commit it at the repository
root and run the linter from anywhere.

The same file also records point exclusions with their reasons: an entry's value is either a
bare count or `{"count": N, "reason": "..."}` – the reason says why the code is right on
purpose. Reasons are written by the "Exclude the finding" lightbulb action of the
[VS Code extension](https://github.com/keyfire/xbsl/blob/main/editors/vscode/README.md#excluding-a-finding-the-baseline) (or by hand);
`--write-baseline` keeps the reasons of the identities that survive a rewrite. The LSP server
accepts the same `--baseline FILE` flag, so exclusions disappear in editors too. The identity
includes the message text: write and check the baseline under the same output language.

## Metadata scaffolding

The toolkit takes over the metadata mechanics: UUIDs, indentation, precise yaml insertions,
duplicate checks and section/kind compatibility. The same operations are exposed through the
CLI (subcommands, JSON output), MCP (the `meta_*` tools for agents) and LSP (the `xbsl/meta*`
custom requests that power the VS Code metadata tree).

33 kinds of project element are creatable – from Справочник and Документ to ВиртуальнаяТаблица
(paired with its mandatory `.xbql` query), ЗапланированноеЗадание, contracts, rights and
commands. Each kind carries what the docs make mandatory: the platform's own default scope
(`ВПодсистеме` – widen it deliberately with `--scope`), a module stub for the handler the kind
cannot live without, and a note for whatever the generator must not invent for you. Kinds whose
content is drawn in the designer (ПанельОтчетов, ПроцессИнтеграции) are deliberately absent.

![The VS Code tree, AI agents and the terminal call the same scaffolding core; it writes created and point-edited yaml/xbsl files, the linter checks what was written, and the response carries files, notes and the lint report; the LSP surface returns full texts for the editor to apply](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keyfire/xbsl/main/images/scaffolding.png)

```sh
xbsl new-project . vendor App                        # Проект.yaml + Проект.xbsl + a subsystem
xbsl new-object vendor/App/Основное Справочник Товары
xbsl add-field vendor/App/Основное/Товары.yaml реквизит Цвет --type Строка
xbsl add-form . --name Товары                        # object + list forms, registered
xbsl add-form . --name Товары --forms list-cards     # list form as a card grid
xbsl new-object ... HttpСервис Каталог --routes "GET /, POST /, GET /{id}"
xbsl add-route  .../Каталог.yaml "DELETE /{id}"      # url template + handler stub
xbsl add-subsystem vendor/App Задачи
xbsl add-dependency . acme CurrencyConverter 2.0      # library into the project's Библиотеки
xbsl rename-object . Товары Номенклатура             # rename files + update references
xbsl set-access . --name Товары --default РазрешеноАутентифицированным
xbsl object-info . --name Товары                     # fields, tabulars, forms, namespace
xbsl project-info .                                  # projects, subsystems, objects by kind
```

Forms are generated with real content: input fields per attribute (including the standard
Наименование / Номер / Дата and hierarchy support), dynamic-list columns, tabular-section
tables, a report form with parameters; the form is registered in the owner's `Интерфейс`
section. `--dry-run` prints the changes (with full file texts) without writing – this is how
the VS Code extension applies them through its own undo-friendly edits.

`--forms list-cards` builds the list form as a card grid instead of a table: a
`ПроизвольныйСписок` whose `КонтейнерСтрок` is a matrix group, plus the row component
`СтрокаСписка<Имя>`. The card takes a title, a photo (a `ДвоичныйОбъект.Ссылка` attribute
switches it to `ПроизвольнаяКарточка` with the image above the caption) and up to three more
fields, dates formatted; notes report what landed on the card and what did not.
`--card-min-width` sets the grid column width (default 400, 250 with a photo) and
`--card-placeholder` the image shown when the photo is empty.

`add-dependency` attaches a library – the `Библиотеки` section of `Проект.yaml` (`Имя`,
`Поставщик`, `Версия`). The version is the library's **release** version: a release is issued
in the control panel, and a build version with a suffix (`1.0-42`) is rejected. Different
versions of one library within a project are not allowed, so attaching an already attached
library updates the version of the existing entry. What is attached now – `project-info`
(`projects[].libraries`). The vendor, name, version and the qualified type names of a library
come from parsing its archive: `elemctl inspect <file.xlib>`.

`set-access` edits `КонтрольДоступа.Разрешения` in place, aware of what each kind allows:
`--default` sets the ПоУмолчанию right, `--permission Чтение=РазрешеноВсем` an individual one
(custom rights of a `ПравоНаЭлемент` included), `--calc-by` fills `РасчетРазрешенийПо` –
mandatory for `РазрешенияВычисляютсяДляКаждогоОбъекта`. Wrong methods, rights a kind does not
have, and per-object rights on a `НаборКонстант` are rejected; the computed-permission
handlers stay yours to write (notes say which). `object-info` reports the current permissions
and the kind's rights, `project-info` the ПоУмолчанию of every object – no section there means
the platform applies `РазрешеноАдминистраторам`.

`rename-object` renames the object's files (including its forms and the `СтрокаСписка<Имя>`
row component) and rewrites references context-aware across the whole project: yaml
type/table/form keys, `=` bindings and .xbsl code. Attributes, components or dynamic-list
fields that merely share the old name are left alone, and so are string literals (UI text);
`--new-presentation`/`--old-presentation` update the Заголовок/Представление values of the
object and its forms. The object's `Ид` is untouched, so the platform keeps the stored data.

## Extending: your own rules, data and severities

Three entry point groups let a separate package extend the linter without forking it. This exists
for teams whose rules or language data cannot be published: keep those in a private package that
depends on `xbsl`.

```toml
# pyproject.toml of your package
dependencies = ["xbsl>=0.16"]

[project.entry-points."xbsl.rules"]
myproject = "myproject.rules"        # importing the module runs its @rule decorators

[project.entry-points."xbsl.data"]
myproject = "myproject:data_root"    # a path, or a callable returning one

[project.entry-points."xbsl.severity"]
myproject = "myproject:severity_overrides"   # {rule id: "error"|"warning"|"info"|"off"}
```

Packages that declared the groups under the pre-rename name (`xbsllint.rules`/`xbsllint.data`/
`xbsllint.severity`) keep working: the legacy groups are scanned after the new ones.

The severity dict (or a zero-argument callable returning one) raises or lowers the default level
of any rule – built-in or plugin – for every run in this installation: a project may treat, say,
`style/abbreviation-case` as a warning while the published default stays info. `"off"` removes a
rule from the default set (an explicit `--select`/`--enable` still turns it on, at its base level).

Install the package and the CLI, the MCP server and the web UI all pick everything up – no flags,
no config file. A failing entry point raises instead of warning: a linter that silently drops a
rule stays green in CI and guarantees nothing; an override naming an unknown rule id or level
raises for the same reason. `XBSL_NO_PLUGINS=1` ignores every external package (built-in
rules, bundled data and default severities only).

## LSP server (experimental)

`xbsl-lsp` (the `[lsp]` extra: `pip install "xbsl[lsp]"`) runs the linter as a
long-living Language Server over stdio: live per-file diagnostics as you type, project-wide
diagnostics on save, go to definition, completion and hover over a resident project index,
and quick-fix code actions - without paying the interpreter start-up cost per call. Flags:
`--project-root` (the sources root relative to the workspace folder), `--select`/`--ignore`/
`--enable`, `--data-dir`. Any LSP-capable editor (VS Code, Neovim, JetBrains) can spawn it.

## Documentation (searching the Element reference)

`tools/extract_docs.py` extracts the Element reference from a distribution (the server-with-IDE
`.car`) into a `docs.sqlite` next to the language data: the stdlib pages (a type, its methods,
properties, parameters) with cleaned HTML, a full-text index (SQLite FTS5, from the standard
library) and canonical links back to the primary source (`https://1cmycloud.com/docs/help/...`,
taken from the distribution's `sitemap.xml`). Page images are stored alongside. The 1C reference is
copyrighted, so the database is not shipped in the package – you generate it from your own
distribution, like the language data (step 1).

```sh
python tools/extract_docs.py --dist "$ELEMENT_DIST"
```

The runtime API `xbsl.docs` (`search`, `page`, `tree`, `for_symbol`, `asset`) reads
`docs.sqlite`; with no database the search is simply empty. It powers the MCP tools (below) and –
later – the reference panel in the VS Code extension.

## MCP server

A thin adapter over the same core: an agent (e.g. Claude Code) can call the checks as tools and
receive structured diagnostics.

```sh
pip install -e ".[mcp]"
claude mcp add xbsl -- xbsl-mcp
```

Tools: `lint_paths(paths)`, `lint_source(filename, content)`, `list_rules()`; documentation search –
`docs_search(query)`, `docs_page(id)`, `docs_symbol(name)` (needs the `docs.sqlite` database, see
above); `type_members(name)` – the members of a stdlib type with the return-type roots of its
methods in one compact answer (cheaper than a docs page when only the member list matters);
metadata scaffolding – `meta_new_project`, `meta_new_object`, `meta_add_field`,
`meta_add_route`, `meta_add_form`, `meta_add_subsystem`, `meta_add_dependency`,
`meta_rename_object` (with a `dry_run` plan mode), `meta_set_access`, `meta_object_info`,
`meta_project_info`.
Every writing `meta_*` tool applies the changes and returns the lint of the written files in the
same response – creation and validation in one round trip. The core and the CLI do not require
`mcp` – it lives only in the `[mcp]` extra.

## Web interface

A local page: point it at a project folder and see the diagnostics. Standard library only (no
external dependencies), binds to `127.0.0.1` only.

```sh
xbsl-web            # then open http://127.0.0.1:8771/
```

Per-tier rule toggles, a data-version selector, severity/text filters, dark/light theme; clicking
a diagnostic opens the file in VS Code (`vscode://`).

## Editor support (VS Code)

A VS Code extension in [`editors/vscode`](editors/vscode) gives `.xbsl` syntax highlighting,
live diagnostics as you type (`--stdin`), workspace diagnostics on save (a full linter run in
the background brings the project-scope rules into the editor), index-based go-to-definition
and completion across the project (`xbsl --index`), a form preview with a properties
panel, and a deploy button powered by [elemctl](https://github.com/keyfire/elemctl). It is
published on the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=keyfire.xbsl)
and [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/keyfire/xbsl); its
[README](editors/vscode/README.md) covers settings, behavior and requirements. See also the
companion [XBSL Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=keyfire.xbsl-debug)
extension from the [elemctl](https://github.com/keyfire/elemctl) project.

## Element versions

The data is versioned by platform version:

```
xbsl/data/element/
    index.json            # { available: [...], default: "<version>" }
    <version>/{language.json, stdlib.json, metamodel.json}
```

Pick a version with `--element-version` / the `XBSL_ELEMENT_VERSION` env var / the index
`default`; `--version` shows what is available. Add a new version by re-running the extractors with
a new `--dist`.

The data root itself is resolved in this order: `--data-dir` > `XBSL_DATA_DIR` > a root supplied
by an installed `xbsl.data` entry point > `xbsl/data/element` inside the package.

## Tests

```sh
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
```

Data-dependent tests are skipped automatically when the data has not been generated.
