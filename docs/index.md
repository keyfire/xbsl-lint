XBSL is a toolkit for **1C:Element** projects written as `Name.yaml` (element description) and
`Name.xbsl` (code module) pairs. It gives fast local feedback ahead of the slow server-side
compilation that runs on deploy – the only check the platform itself provides. The project
ships as a Python engine and a VS Code extension built on top of it.

## What is in the box

- **Linter with autofixes** – 97 rules in four tiers: yaml structure, text and typography
  conventions, code structure, and semantics checked against the platform data and the project
  itself.
- **LSP server** – live diagnostics, go-to-definition and completion for any LSP-capable editor.
- **Metadata scaffolding** – creating objects, attributes, routes and forms without hand-writing
  yaml.
- **Documentation search** – a local full-text index built from your own 1C:Element
  distribution.
- **MCP server** – linting, documentation search and every scaffolding operation exposed as
  tools for AI agents.
- **[VS Code extension](https://github.com/keyfire/xbsl/blob/main/editors/vscode/README.md)**
  (publisher `keyfire`, extension id `keyfire.xbsl`) – syntax highlighting, project-wide
  diagnostics, the form designer, a metadata tree and a deploy button, all backed by the same
  engine.

- **[Guide](/GUIDE)** – installation, CLI flags, CI setup, the baseline mechanism, metadata
  scaffolding, extending the linter with your own rules, and the LSP and MCP servers.
- **[Rules](/RULES)** – the full list of linter checks, with severities and scope.
- **[Visual designer](/DESIGNER)** – the form panel, the palette, the properties panel and
  following the cursor.
- **[Documentation panel](/DOCS_PANEL)** – the platform help inside the editor: contents,
  search, the page for a symbol.
- **[README on GitHub](https://github.com/keyfire/xbsl/blob/main/README.md)** – the short
  project tour and quick-start commands.
- **[Contributing](https://github.com/keyfire/xbsl/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)** – how to add a
  rule or update the language data.

## Nearby

The 1C:Element toolkit is two halves of one loop, and a third tool does the same job on the
neighbouring platform.

- **[Elemctl](https://docs.keyfire.ru/elemctl/)** – delivery of what the linter has checked: build from
  sources, upload, apply, and an honest verification that the stand actually came up on the
  new build. The *XBSL: deploy* command of the VS Code extension calls exactly this.
- **[EDT-Bridge](https://docs.keyfire.ru/edt-bridge/)** – the same idea on the 1C:Enterprise platform: an MCP
  bridge into 1C:EDT through which an agent reads the configuration, edits modules and forms,
  builds extensions and debugs.

Language data (keywords, the stdlib type catalog, the configuration metamodel) is generated
from your own 1C:Element distribution and is not bundled with the project – see
[Language data](/GUIDE#language-data) in the guide.
