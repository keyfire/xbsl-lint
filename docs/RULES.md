# xbsl linter rules

**English** · [Русский](https://github.com/keyfire/xbsl/blob/main/docs/RULES.ru.md)

The full list of linter checks. This file is extended as rules are added; the live list at
runtime is `xbsl list-rules` (or the MCP `list_rules`). Currently there are 87 rules.

## Boundary: the linter complements the compiler, it does not replace it

The linter works over text, the AST and the project model, with first-hop type knowledge
only (the declared nominal types of variables - no inference of expression types). It
catches what the Element compiler does not check or reports unclearly (conventions,
typography, structure, references to non-existent types and objects) plus the provable
signature-level mistakes (a return not matching the method signature, a wrong argument
count of a local call, a non-exception in `поймать`, a missing member of a plain stdlib
type), but NOT what needs full inference: a redundant cast, an unclosed resource, the
type of a returned value. Code correctness is verified by the server-side compilation on
deploy; the linter runs before it and removes common mistakes early.

## How to read the table

- **Rule** – the `group/name` identifier. The group (the part before `/`) lets you enable and
  disable rules in bulk.
- **Severity** – `error` (a build/CI should fail), `warning` (a convention is broken),
  `info` (a hint, usually off).
- **Default** – whether the rule is in the default set (`on`) or is enabled explicitly (`off`).
- **Scope** – `file` (the rule sees one file) or `project` (needs the whole-project index:
  duplicate Ids, unknown types, cross-module calls).
- **Docs** – a link to the platform documentation section behind the rule. In VS Code the code
  of such a rule in the Problems panel opens that section right in the editor.

## Tiers

Rules are split into tiers A-D by what they rely on. A tier is also a quick filter for
`--select`/`--ignore` (alongside the group and the identifier): `--select A,B` runs only
structure and text, `--ignore D` drops the semantics over stdlib.

### Tier A - structure and YAML

The file exists, parses, the object has a unique UUID, the name matches the file.

| Rule | Severity | Default | Scope | What it checks | Docs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `yaml/valid` | error | on | file | YAML does not parse | – |
| `yaml/id-uuid` | error | on | file | Ид is not a UUID | – |
| `yaml/id-required` | warning | on | file | The object has no Ид | – |
| `yaml/name-matches-file` | warning | on | file | Имя does not match the file name | – |
| `yaml/id-unique` | error | on | project | Duplicate Ид in the project | – |
| `project/identifier` | warning | on | file | Project name or vendor is not an identifier | [docs](https://1cmycloud.com/docs/help/topics/project-properties-standard/) |
| `project/presentation` | warning | on | file | Project presentation is empty | [docs](https://1cmycloud.com/docs/help/topics/project-properties-standard/) |
| `project/version` | warning | on | file | Project version is not A.B.C | [docs](https://1cmycloud.com/docs/help/topics/project-properties-standard/) |
| `structure/xbsl-pair` | warning | on | file | Module .xbsl without a paired .yaml | – |

### Tier B - text and conventions

Encoding, newlines, whitespace, typography (dashes, quotes, ellipsis), line length, secrets
in the sources.

| Rule | Severity | Default | Scope | What it checks | Docs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `security/hardcoded-secret` | error | on | file | A key or a password as a literal | – |
| `typography/em-dash` | info | off | file | Em dash in a comment | – |
| `typography/ellipsis` | warning | on | file | Ellipsis character in a comment | – |
| `typography/curly-quotes` | warning | on | file | Curly quotes | – |
| `typography/guillemets-comment` | info | off | file | Guillemets in a comment | – |
| `whitespace/trailing` | warning | on | file | Trailing whitespace | – |
| `whitespace/mixed-newline` | warning | on | file | Mixed newlines | – |
| `encoding/utf8` | error | on | file | File is not UTF-8 | – |

| `style/line-length` | info | off | file | Line longer than 120 characters | [docs](https://1cmycloud.com/docs/help/topics/general-design/) |

### Tier C - code structure, basic syntax and code-writing conventions

Block and bracket balance, loop and method headers, local variables and the `style/` group -
conventions from the documentation section "Code-writing recommendations". Some `style/` rules
are off by default (accumulated debt, `info`): enable them with `--select style` to measure.

## Group details

### Queries: `IN` with a subquery over a composite type (rule `query/in-subquery-composite`)

A platform standard: `IN` with a subquery over an expression of a composite type is implemented
inefficiently on most DBMSs, so the condition is written with `EXISTS` instead. The rule is a
warning – the standard is mandatory:

```
WHERE T.Value IN (SELECT F.Value FROM Filters AS F)                    // warning
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Filters AS F WHERE F.Value = T.Value)      // this way
```

A type counts as composite when the yaml spells two or more alternatives (`Строка|Число|?`): the
`?` is not a type but the admissibility of `Неопределено`, and `Массив<Строка|Число>` is not
composite either. Only a field whose type is known for sure is questioned: `Alias.Field` or
`Table.Field`, where the alias is unambiguous within the block and the field is found in the
table's yaml; a list of values (`IN (1, 2, &Codes)`) is not what the standard is about. Both
spellings of the query language are understood (`В`/`IN`, `НЕ`/`NOT`, `ВЫБРАТЬ`/`SELECT`).

### Project properties (the `project/` rules)

Three rules from the standard "Filling in the project properties": `Поставщик` and `Имя` are
identifiers built from the presentations (every word capitalized: `КабинетСотрудника`,
`НовыеЭлементарныеТехнологии`); `Представление` and `ПредставлениеПоставщика` are filled in – the
official name of the project and of the company that developed it; `Версия` is three numbers
`A.B.C` (semantic versioning), not `1.0`.

### Names of project elements (the `naming/` rules)

Twelve rules from the platform standard "Names of project elements" – it is mandatory in new code,
so all of them are warnings. They read the descriptions (`.yaml`): the name of the element itself
and the names of its attributes, dimensions, resources, tabular sections and enumeration values.

The number of a name is checked against the kind: catalogs, documents, registers and tabular
sections are named in the plural, enumerations and structures in the singular (`naming/number`).
This is morphology, not a guess by the ending: `Номенклатура` is singular and the standard allows
it, while `Программы` and `Акции` without the case read as a genitive singular. Needs the `[morph]`
extra (`pip install "xbsl[morph]"`); without it the rule stays silent.

The rest: the letter `ё` and underscores in names, an abbreviation written as one word (`Ндс`, not
`НДС`), an English term as the original (`Xml`, not `Хмл`), `Вид` rather than `Тип` for
enumerations, the kind inside its own name (`ОтчетЗависшиеЗадачи`), filler words (`Управление`,
`Менеджер`), an environment suffix on a common module (`ОбменДаннымиКлиентИСервер` – the
environment is a property, not a name), a boolean attribute named by a negation (`НетОшибок`
instead of `Успешно`), an empty `Представление`, and the prefixes required for certain kinds
(`КлючДоступа`, `ПравоНа`, `Навигация`).

### Code style conventions (the `style/` rules)

Twenty-one rules that follow the platform documentation ("Code style conventions" and "Language
idioms"): layout and expression wrapping, naming, type descriptions and signatures, collection
literals, string interpolation, and checks of boolean values and `Неопределено`.

Rules that clean code already satisfies are enabled by default (`warning`) – they guard against
regressions. Rules that typically fire on accumulated legacy debt are `info` and disabled; enable
them to measure the debt and pay it down:

```sh
xbsl path/to/sources --select style     # ONLY these rules (replaces the default set)
xbsl path/to/sources --enable style     # the default set PLUS these
xbsl path/to/sources --ignore style     # the default set minus these
```

`--select`, `--enable` and `--ignore` accept a rule id, a group (the part before `/`) or a tier
letter, repeated or comma-separated. `--select` narrows to exactly the given rules; `--enable`
switches on off-by-default rules on top of the defaults.

`Запрос{ ... }` blocks (the query DSL) and string literals (HTML/CSS/SVG in web views) are
excluded from these checks. Not covered, and left to the author and review: indentation being a
multiple of four, collection idioms, `Строки.Соединить()` for bulk concatenation, the `?.` / `??`
idioms, and `выбор` instead of an `иначе если` chain.

## Enabling and disabling

`--select` and `--ignore` accept a rule identifier, a group (the part before `/`, e.g. `style`)
or a tier letter `A`/`B`/`C`/`D`. A plugin may override a rule's severity (the `xbsl.severity`
entry-points group); `XBSL_NO_PLUGINS=1` disables plugins and restores the built-in values from
this table.
